# Analysis for Scott County Manuscript

This repo is made up of scripts used for analysis in a particular manuscript for the Marshall Research Group. This manuscript is an investigation on how the structural characteristics of injection drug use networks influence HIV epidemic behavior. Specifically, I compared the characteristics of the observed contact tracing network from the 2015 HIV outbreak in Scott County, Indiana with a set of simulated networks generated by our stochastic, agent-based network model. You can find the published manuscript here: [Network structure and rapid HIV transmission among people who inject drugs: A simulation-based analysis](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1755436520300463).

# Usage
